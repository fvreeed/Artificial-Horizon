# Artificial-Horizon
Project in university. Moscow Aviation Institute

In this project we used:
Module with gyroscope, accelerometer and thermometer based on MPU-6050 chip
OLED display with screen resolution 128x64 pixels, diagonal 0.96 inches.
A miniature board of the Arduino family, built on the ATmega168 microcontroller.

Our team designed a connection diagram
elements for Arduino.

We connect:
SDA to A4 (Green wires)
SCL to A5 (Blue wires)
VCC from display to 3V3
VCC from MPU to 5V
GND to GND
